:brain: VERSION 2 PSEUDO-CODE WORKSHEET
-------------------------------------
This is our WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, HOW framework for working with data:
1. WHAT data should we store & retrieve?
   List the key/value pair, data type, example value.
2. WHEN should we store & retrieve the data?
   What event or user action is the trigger, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or loading a page?
3. WHERE does this happen in the code?
   What component, page or function?
4. HOW do we accomplish this?
   What steps do we need to take?
   Do we need to...
    - render anything in JSX?
    - make any functions? If so, when would we call those functions?
    - use any useState or useEffect hooks?
    - set or get an item from localStorage?
  Remember: This is pseudo-code. Don't write code yet â€” just outline the actions in plain language.
:sparkles: YOUR TASK: Fill in the answers to each WHAT/WHEN/WHERE/HOW question below for the 3 pieces of data.
------------------------
:bar_chart: FORM DATA
------------------------
WHAT data should we store & retrieve?
KEY: "User"
VALUE: "Name", "Email", "Country", "Bio" - data from the form that user submits
VALUE DATA TYPE: Object
EXAMPLE VALUE: {
    name: "Tamara",

}
------------------------
:large_orange_diamond: STORING FORM DATA
------------------------
WHEN: When user clicks submit button 

WHERE: SavedCountries page

HOW: 
Step 1: We create a handleSubmit function that gets the values from the from and saves it in localStorage
Step 2: We add the handleSubmit as an onSubmit prop on the form in JSX - make sure that the function is being called when the user clicks submit

Add more steps as needed!
------------------------
:large_orange_diamond: RETRIEVING FORM DATA
------------------------
WHEN: When user loads the SavedCountries page

WHERE: On the SavedCountries page above the form

HOW: setFormData
Step 1: We need to make a useEffect that retrieves the Form data on pageload and saves it in state
Step 2: We render the state variable in the (Home) JSX as a heading that says "Welcome[User]!"
