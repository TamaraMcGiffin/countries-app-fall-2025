:brain: VERSION 2 PSEUDO-CODE WORKSHEET
-------------------------------------
This is our WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, HOW framework for working with data:
1. WHAT data should we store & retrieve?
   List the key/value pair, data type, example value.
2. WHEN should we store & retrieve the data?
   What event or user action is the trigger, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or loading a page?
3. WHERE does this happen in the code?
   What component, page or function?
4. HOW do we accomplish this?
   What steps do we need to take?
   Do we need to...
    - render anything in JSX?
    - make any functions? If so, when would we call those functions?
    - use any useState or useEffect hooks?
    - set or get an item from localStorage?
  Remember: This is pseudo-code. Don't write code yet â€” just outline the actions in plain language.
:sparkles: YOUR TASK: Fill in the answers to each WHAT/WHEN/WHERE/HOW question below for the 3 pieces of data.
------------------------
:bar_chart: FORM DATA
------------------------
WHAT data should we store & retrieve?
KEY: "User"
VALUE: "Name", "Email", "Country", "Bio" - data from the form that user submits
VALUE DATA TYPE: Object
EXAMPLE VALUE: {
    name: "Tamara", 
    email: "tamaramcgiffin@gmail.com",
    country: "USA", 
    bio: "Country Connosieur - Worldly Traveler ðŸŒŽ"
}
------------------------
:large_orange_diamond: STORING FORM DATA
------------------------
WHEN: When user clicks submit button 

WHERE: savedCountries page

HOW: 
Step 1: We create a handleSubmit function that gets the values from the from and saves it in localStorage
Step 2: We add the handleSubmit as an onSubmit prop on the form in JSX - make sure that the function is being called when the user clicks submit

Add more steps as needed!
------------------------
:large_orange_diamond: RETRIEVING FORM DATA
------------------------
WHEN: When user loads the savedCountries page

WHERE: On the savedCountries page above the form

HOW: setFormData
Step 1: We need to make a useEffect that retrieves the Form data on pageload and saves it in state
Step 2: We render the state variable in the (Home) JSX as a heading that says "Welcome[User]!"

Add more steps as needed!
------------------------
:bar_chart: SAVED COUNTRIES DATA
------------------------
WHAT data should we store & retrieve?
KEY: "savedCountries"
VALUE: An array of saved country names - countryName
VALUE DATA TYPE: An array of strings
EXAMPLE VALUE: [Afghanistan, India, China,]
------------------------
:large_orange_diamond: STORING SAVED COUNTRIES DATA
------------------------
WHEN: When user clicks 'save' button
WHERE: On the CountryDetail page by click on 'save' button
HOW:
Step 1: We need to attach an onClick handler to the 'save' button on the CountryDetail pages
Step 2: When the user clicks on the 'save' button, call the handleClick function
Step 3: The handleClick function needs to save the country's name in localStorage
Step 3: The handleClick function will first get the array of saved countries from localStorage. 
If the country is already saved, then there is no need to save the country. If the country is not saved yet, then add the country's name to the array of savedCountries and store that value in localStorage.
------------------------
:large_orange_diamond: RETRIEVING SAVED COUNTRIES DATA
------------------------
WHEN: On page load when we load the Saved Countries page
WHERE: On saved countries page in Saved Countries section
HOW:
Step 1: Make a useEffect that runs on page load. It will...
Step 2: Get the array of savedCountries from localStorage
Step 3: Store it in a state variable
Step 4: Map over the array of objects and render a countryCard for each item in the array. (Render the state variable in JSX as CountryCards.)

Add more steps as needed!
------------------------
:bar_chart: COUNTRY COUNTS DATA
------------------------
WHAT data should we store & retrieve?
KEY: "The country's name"
VALUE: The country's viewCount as a number
VALUE DATA TYPE: Number
EXAMPLE VALUE: 5
------------------------
:large_orange_diamond: STORING & RETRIEVING COUNTRY COUNTS DATA
------------------------
NOTE: We combine storing & retrieving country counts data into one section because they always happen together. Each time we look up a countryâ€™s view count, we also need to increase it and save the new total.

WHEN: When the user views the country's detail page, on page load (think useEffect)

WHERE: In the country detail page

HOW:
Step 1: useState for viewCount

Step 2: create useEffect to: 
(1) Retrieve the current viewCount
(2) Add 1
(3) Store the new number in localStorage

Step 3: Update the value of viewCount using setViewCount
Add more steps as needed!

Step 4: Show the viewCount variable to the user by rendering it in the JSX
